A Utility to Run Large Numbers of Shell Commands Protecting from Errors

Usage

  1. Start up the ./foreman script which oversees all work to be done.
     Pass it a single command line argument which will set the maximum
     time for which any job will be allowed to run.

  2. Write jobs to files in the work/ directory with the .run
     extension. E.g.,

       $ echo "uname -a" > work/foo.run

  3. When these command completes the results will be written to a
     file in the work/ directory with the .run extension is replaced
     with .done.  The first line of this file will holds the numeric
     exit code of the command, the remainder of the file will hold the
     output to STDOUT (if any).

       $ cat work/foo.done
